Generation error

The Generator stumbled upon something that does not fit.

Error: The X type is defined as an empty enum (enum with no members). This type is not supported by the generator as it has no values to match against (much like never). See here for more: https://github.com/peter-leonov/type-predicate-generator/issues/11

To see the the stacktrace use the --withStacktrace switch.

If you feel this is a bug in the generator, pretty please report it here:
