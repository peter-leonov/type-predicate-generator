# Contributing

You're very welcome to contribute to this project. The ways to contribute are as follows but not limited to:

- refactor and simplify the code
- improve usability
- submit feature requests
- test and report bugs

The process is simple. As the project is being actively developed it's important to sync first before digging into the code, so please create an issue with a one liner about what you'd like to change. We discuss the idea and go for it.

[Here](https://github.com/peter-leonov/type-predicate-generator?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing) is an overview of the technicalities of the project.

Happy hacking!
